## **Skip lists** data structure

## What it is *by Wikipedia*
In computer science, a skip list is a data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, with each successive subsequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one. Searching starts in the sparsest subsequence until two consecutive elements have been found, one smaller and one larger than or equal to the element searched for. Via the linked hierarchy, these two elements link to elements of the next sparsest subsequence, where searching is continued until finally we are searching in the full sequence. The elements that are skipped over may be chosen probabilistically or deterministically, with the former being more common.

## What do we need for building the sources
- For this application I used the Delphi 10 Studio. For opening the project you have to run `Project1.dproj` file. 
- All documentation's located in `Win32\Debug\SkipListAlghoritm.html`. 

## Benefits of my solution

- Simple using
- Graphic interface
- Supported by any Windows 7+ system
- Portable version
- Included documentation
- Small size
